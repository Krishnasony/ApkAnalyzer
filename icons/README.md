# Icon Placeholders

This extension requires three icon sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons
You can create your own icons or use the following simple approach:

1. Use any image editor (like GIMP, Photoshop, or online tools)
2. Create a simple design with an APK/Android theme
3. Export in the required sizes
4. Replace the placeholder files in the icons/ directory

## Placeholder Description
The current placeholder icons should be replaced with actual APK analyzer themed icons.
Suggested design: Android robot with magnifying glass or comparison arrows.
